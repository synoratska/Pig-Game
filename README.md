Here is deployed version:
### [Live Site](https://pig-game-vanilla.netlify.app/)

## Introduction

The game has two players, playing in rounds.
In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he wishes.
Each result gets added to his round score.
BUT:
If player rolls a 1, all his round score gets lost and turn goes to next player.
The player can choose to 'Hold' button, which means that his round score gets added to his global score. After that => next player turn.
The first player to reach 100 points on global score wins the game.

Have fun :)
